# This workflow works by removing a "Needs QA" label from a PR when the actor is
# a dependabot user. It runs when a PR is merged.
#
# We need this mechanism to allow for automerging whitelisted dependencies while
# also allowing for blocking a merge to master for deployment (in the way that
# our other PRs work).
